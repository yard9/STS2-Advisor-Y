## How the logic currently works

The current decision logic is based on a mix of practical run experience, community knowledge, and some experimentation.

Right now it mainly relies on:

- decision patterns I would typically follow during my own runs
- information and strategies from various community guides
- some unconventional card combinations I’ve experimented with that might work well together
- some AI-assisted exploration of card synergies and how certain cards can interact or enable specific builds

---

## Known issues

The logic still needs tuning and there are definitely cases where recommendations will be wrong.

If you notice something off, feel free to open an issue and include:

- character
- deck
- cards offered
- what result you expected

---

## Planned improvements

- Add missing cards
- Relic synergy
- Better archetype detection
- Improved card scoring logic
- More accurate deck health metrics
- Better support for future STS2 updates

---

## Disclaimer

This tool is experimental and the scoring logic is still evolving.
It should be treated as a helper, not a perfect decision maker.
